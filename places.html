            The City Of Manila have a special place in my heart that really values it's exhibit. I've gone to different places there<br>
            like Manila Zoo, Luneta Park, Intramuros, National Fine Arts Museum, Quiapo and ton of unfamiliar streets I've passed by.<br>
            Of course my experience would be meaningless without the appearance of my friends. They honestly made my first time experiences <br>
            there quite enjoyable and unforgettable. Manila have too many beautiful things to offer so might as well experience it too.<br>

            This is where I spent my last high school years that I still hold it's preciousness that built the person I am today.<br>
            I am really glad to be in this place and forever will be. A lot of new people I became close with and few that I maybe dislike.<br>
            Many version of me occured here but still made the one I am today. Many new and repeated experiences happened that completely<br>
            shaped my journey here. I am forever grateful of being there and meeting those people that's been with it.<br>
